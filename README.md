Test repo for Coursera Data Science course

Making some additional changes locally to see if I can get it to merge to GitHub

## More Markdown Testing

On May 30, I watched the Coursera course on markdown and learned about different heading sizes

### Making lists

* this is a first item
* this is a second item
* this is a third item

I made that list and then edited this a bit more, as I had intended the list heading to be tertiary (not secondary)
